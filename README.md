# Grow Your Pet!
Roblox game called Grow Your Pet. Inspired by Grow A Garden and Steal A Brainrot.
Modeling is the main amount of time for this project.
There are 2 types of files in this project: Devlog files and Version files. Devlog files are well, for devlogs. Version files are for each session and what has been changed in that session. I didnt really do much devlog files so check out the project page for those!
You can skip this part if you have Roblox on your computer --> To do the demo, go to https://roblox.com. Create an account on there. After, click on the demo and follow the steps that Roblox gives when installing the player when you press play. Enjoy the game!
Previously, this project was called Grow A Fish Bowl and Grow a Brainrot, but i changed it to have brainrots instead of fish because brainrot, then i realized people REALLY dont like brainrot so thats why the devlogs/commits are under fish and brainrots, and the rest are under regular pet stuff now.
